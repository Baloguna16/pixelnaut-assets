# Pixelnaut Assets and Pixelnaut Canvas Builder

'orcanaut-pixelator' - a react app for generating animated canvasses from pixelnaut assets
'pixelnaut-spirte-assets' - all the sprites as 10-frame .png files, ready for you to use
'pixelnaut-aseprite-files'- the .aseprite files if you want to remix the pixelnauts to meet your needs

The pixelnaut assets were produced by me (TW: @Ade_in_myLife) and inspired by
Corcorarium's work (TW: @corcorarium) for the Orcanauts Project (https://orcanauts.orca.so).

Feel free to use the assets as you wish; however, you do not have permission to resell
them or claim them as your own work.
